As a quality measure with the more expensive engines, we set a minimum limit of upvotes to use with certain engines. We did this as we wanted to get the best return from the engines within our budget. We used 15 upvotes as the minimum limit for the babbage engine and 50 upvotes as the minimum for the curie engine. We eventually did away with this as our dataset got large enough where the idea of prioritizing "quality posts" wasn't much of concern anymore. This potentially introduced biases, particularly when including posts with lower upvotes in sentiment analysis tasks. That said, no obvious biases were observed. However, this wasn't particularly investigated either. One circumvention to avoid any biases that may have been introduced though is by including a post limit when retrieving data for sentiment analysis/running through the models.
