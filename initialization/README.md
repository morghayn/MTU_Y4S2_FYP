# Notes
## What is the "initial insertion"?
The initial insertion is whereby we fetch posts from the past year that meet the criteria we defined, a post/comment mentioning a company's name or stock ticker that is enlisted within the S&P500 index.

Further, this list may be extended at some point to allow for other stocks of our choosing to be included. The reason we have opted for such a means of post/comment selection is so as not to retrieve posts mentioning companies with very low market caps, as this will retrieve low-quality "pumper-posts".

Is this making our data biased? Perhaps. But we can deduce we will be retrieving higher quality data, and the intentions of this dataset is to applied only to stable-medium risk financial securities; i.e, mid-cap stocks (market caps with $2-10 billion) and large-cap stocks.

## Dangers of the delete table command.
The delete table command is dangerous and is recognized as such. Measures to prevent accidental deletion will be implemented as this project progresses.
